# Digital-System-Design
Resources for use in Digital System Design. 
## Goal
The first goal for this repository is to provide a set of best practices when designing digital systems.
The advice will mostly concern VHDL for synthesizable designs and Python for testbenches. 
## Methods
With this repository, the attempt is to provide a set of best practices and the rationale behind each practice. 
That is, why is it this method is concidered best practice, and what are the limitations to when it is best practice. 

A discussion section has been added to allow readers to create comments or suggestions
## Motivation
By teaching digital system design for the past few years, we see that students often rely on internet sources when doing digital design. 
At times sources are used blindly without considering strengths and pitfalls in the methodology presented. 
Generative AI also often provide poor results for digital system design compared to software design, as the number of openly coded lines are much fewer. 

Students that rely heavily on internet sources throughout our courses tend to repeat coding strategies that were abandoned years ago from a course perspective, since this is what they find online. 
The rationale for code found online may vary a lot, and it is not always clear to the students. 
Code that is great for certain purposes, such as synthesis, may be difficult to modify without running into trouble because it was not well made for verification or modification. 

By providing best practices and the rationale behind each practice, openly and searchable, we hope that our students will both find this information, and find it useful. 
We also believe that what our set of best practices can be useful to engineers and students all over the world that do digital system design. 

Ideally this repository should allow posting issues and suggestions, so that the best practices can be improved upon over time.
